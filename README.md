# Choosing a JavaScript Framework

This repo contains the source code for my talk on "Choosing a JavaScript 
Framework" that I gave at the 2018 DevNexus Conference in Atlanta, GA.

This presentation demonstrated how to to create a simple Todo application 
using three popular JavaScript Frameworks:
1) Angular
2) React
3) Vue

To run each application follow the instructions found in the README.md file. 
This will show you how to install all dependencies and the command to start 
the server.
